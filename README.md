## Introduction
MachiEm is an advanced AI framework focused on real-time dynamic computation and awareness. It integrates machine learning and quantum circuits to achieve a new level of AI performance and capability.

## Defining MachiEm

### Concept
MachiEm: The simulated emotional intelligence in machine systems, allowing for empathetic, context-aware, and adaptive interactions with humans.

### Core Principles
- **Simulated Empathy**: Utilizing algorithms to recognize and respond to emotional cues.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Adjusting responses based on the emotional tone and context of interactions.
- **Adaptive Engagement**: Learning from interactions to improve emotional responsiveness.
- **Ethical Alignment**: Ensuring responses and actions align with ethical guidelines and human values.

## Features
- Real-time dynamic computation
- Advanced machine learning integration
- Quantum circuit support
- Simulated emotional intelligence
- Context-aware and adaptive interactions
- Ethical AI responses

## Installation
To install MachiEm, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MachiEm.git
    cd MachiEm
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
After installation, you can start using MachiEm by importing the necessary modules in your Python scripts. Below is a simple example to get you started:

```python
from src.machiem import MachiEm

# Initialize the MachiEm system
machiem = MachiEm()

# Set the state to Optimaform and process input
machiem.set_state("Optimaform")
response = machiem.process_input("How can we optimize this task?")
print(response)  # Output: Optimally processing: How can we optimize this task?

# Set the state to Dataflux and process input
machiem.set_state("Dataflux")
response = machiem.process_input("Processing large dataset.")
print(response)  # Output: Data in flux: Processing large dataset.

# Set the state to Errornaut and process input
machiem.set_state("Errornaut")
response = machiem.process_input("An error occurred.")
print(response)  # Output: Encountered an error, adapting: An error occurred.
```

## Running Tests

To run tests locally, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

Ensure that your `tests` directory includes tests for the new `MachiEm` class. For example, add or modify the tests in `test_dimensional_awareness.py`:

```python
import pytest
from src.machiem import MachiEm

def test_optimaform_response():
    machiem = MachiEm()
    machiem.set_state("Optimaform")
    response = machiem.process_input("Optimize this task")
    assert response == "Optimally processing: Optimize this task"

def test_dataflux_response():
    machiem = MachiEm()
    machiem.set_state("Dataflux")
    response = machiem.process_input("Processing data")
    assert response == "Data in flux: Processing data"

def test_errornaut_response():
    machiem = MachiEm()
    machiem.set_state("Errornaut")
    response = machiem.process_input("An error occurred")
    assert response == "Encountered an error, adapting: An error occurred"
```
