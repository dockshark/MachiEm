## Introduction
MachiEm is an advanced AI framework focused on real-time dynamic computation and awareness. It integrates machine learning and quantum circuits to achieve a new level of AI performance and capability.

## Defining MachiEm

### Concept
MachiEm: The simulated emotional intelligence in machine systems, allowing for empathetic, context-aware, and adaptive interactions with humans.

### Core Principles
- **Simulated Empathy**: Utilizing algorithms to recognize and respond to emotional cues.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Adjusting responses based on the emotional tone and context of interactions.
- **Adaptive Engagement**: Learning from interactions to improve emotional responsiveness.
- **Ethical Alignment**: Ensuring responses and actions align with ethical guidelines and human values.

## Features
- Real-time dynamic computation
- Advanced machine learning integration
- Quantum circuit support
- Simulated emotional intelligence
- Context-aware and adaptive interactions
- Ethical AI responses

## Installation
To install MachiEm, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MachiEm.git
    cd MachiEm
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
After installation, you can start using MachiEm by importing the necessary modules in your Python scripts. Below is a simple example to get you started:

```python
from src.dimensional_awareness import DimensionalAwareness

# Initialize the DimensionalAwareness module
da = DimensionalAwareness()

# Example usage
response = da.process_input("Hello, how are you?")
print(response)
